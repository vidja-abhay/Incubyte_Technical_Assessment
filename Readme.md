# Library Management System - TDD

The Library Management System is a comprehensive application built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. This system manages the operations of a library by providing functionality to add users, manage book inventory, issue books to users, and handle the return of borrowed books. The project also includes thorough unit testing using the Vitest framework to ensure the robustness of the application.

## Features

- **User Management**: 
  - Add new users to the system.
  - Maintain user records, including user details and borrowed book history.
  
- **Book Management**: 
  - Add new books to the library collection by authorized personnel (librarian or others).
  - Maintain records of all books in the library, including details such as title, author, ISBN, and availability status.

- **Borrow/Issue Books**:
  - Issue books to users, updating the book's availability status and logging the transaction in the user's borrowing history.
  
- **Return Books**:
  - Process the return of books, updating the book's availability status and closing the transaction in the user's borrowing history.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
- **Express.js**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, used to build the API endpoints.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database program that uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas to store user and book data.
- **Vitest**: A blazing-fast unit testing framework used for testing the functionalities of the system.

## Testing

Unit tests for the Library Management System are written using the Vitest framework. These tests ensure that the various features of the system work as expected.

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

**Test coverage includes**:

- User management functions (e.g., adding users).
- Book management functions (e.g., adding books, issuing books, returning books).
- Error handling and validation.
